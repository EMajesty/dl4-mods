Install the switches without the nut or washers on the inside, this way the pcb should fit without desoldering the original tactile switches.

Wire new switches to the pads of the tactile switches.

Marking the holes is easier if you fit the washer in the recess, then find the center. This way the switches shouldn't conflict with the jacks.

You might have to resolder C15 flat if it touches the switch.
